Hello everyone. This is a WPF Desktop Library System app. 
This project can be used on school libraries to track which student has how many books, how much are they going to have that book etc. Same goes for teacher and lastly there is admin which controls basically everything.
I summarize this project in one sentence above but of course it is far more intricate then that.
